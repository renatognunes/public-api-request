Treehouse Techdegree: FSJS project 5 - Public API Request

This project uses Fetch API to request data from a public API. The project displays an employee directory including all pieces of information from the employees in the database. A gallery contains all employees on an initial page.
The user can select an employee by clicking on a card and will display detailed information about the selected employee.
The user has a search tool which he can use to search for a specific employee. The search will filter all matched results searching for first or last name. When an employee card is clicked, the modal with all information from that employee is displayed, the user can use the buttons at the bottom of the modal to navigate through the employee's dictionary. This project was built with the intention of better understanding HTTP requests, Fetch API, Promises and Asynchronous Programming.

Examiner 
For styling, I've chosen a minimalist approach. 
I removed all the borders from the cards gallery and modals.
I've added transitions with transform to the card's gallery. 
I added a message to the DOM when a search is not found (even though it was not required).
I've made changes in the CSS colors and added darker colors to the modal buttons when the mouse is hover it.
