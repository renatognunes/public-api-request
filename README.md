Public API Request

This project uses Fetch API to request data from a public API. The project displays an employee directory including all pieces of information from the employees in the database. A gallery contains all employees on an initial page.
The user can select an employee by clicking on a card and will display detailed information about the selected employee.
The user has a search tool which he can use to search for a specific employee. The search will filter all matched results searching for first or last name. When an employee card is clicked, the modal with all information from that employee is displayed, the user can use the buttons at the bottom of the modal to navigate through the employee's dictionary.
